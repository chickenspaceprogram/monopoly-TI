monopoly-TI v1.0

---OPERATING REQUIREMENTS---

monopoly-TI is compatible with any calculator in the TI-83/84+ series, except the ones listed below as incompatible.

Incompatible models:
TI-84 Plus CE
TI-84 Plus CE Python

Program size : 1312 bytes

Available memory required to run:
RAM : 20500 bytes (approx.)
ARC : 10000 bytes (approx.)

If you encounter ERR: MEMORY, you need to have more RAM when running the program. Delete matrices [E]-[I] if they've formed, free up more space elsewhere, and try again.

---DESCRIPTION---

monopoly-TI is a program that uses a Markov Chain to find the probabilities of landing on each space in the board game Monopoly.

Please notify me of any bugs or errors you encounter by creating an issue in this project's GitHub repository!

---INCLUDED FILES---

|- MONOSOLV.8xp
|- readme.txt (you are here)

---HOW TO USE---

To use this program, simply download MONOSOLV.8xp.

Then, run prgmMONOSOLV from the PRGM menu.

prgmMONOSOLV will periodically display messages to show progress. These show you that the program is working and can provide a rough idea of where the program broke if you encounter errors.

Total runtime (TI-84+): ~2.5min (~6.5min on TI-83/83+)

---ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS---

Thanks to Kerm Martian for developing SourceCoder 3 (cemetech.com/sc), which made finding errors and debugging this mess far easier.

---POSSIBLE FUTURE ADDITIONS---

- Optimize and neaten code
- Add proper progress indicators to all parts of the program
