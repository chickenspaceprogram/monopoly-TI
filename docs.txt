PROGRAM STRUCTURE:

prgmMONOGEN
 |--prgmLEAVJAIL
 |--prgmCHANCE
 |--prgmCOMCHEST
 |--prgmSENDJAIL

prgmREFLM
 |--prgmROWSWPLM
 |--prgmROWADDLM
 |--prgmROWMLTLM

prgmRREFLM

prgmGETPROBS

Each of the top-level programs run in order, as do the subroutines of prgmMONOGEN. As such, it would be very easy to combine most of the code into a singular program. However, breaking the program into subroutines and functions as done here makes it easier to troubleshoot, which is why that was done here.

VARIABLES USED:

Many real variables were used, as well as lists L1, PROBS, and RREF. Matrix [E] was used to store the main matrix. More detail on when these variables are used will be provided in future versions of this documentation.

NOTES/INFO:

At some point, I plan on turning prgmREFLM and prgmRREFLM into standalone utilities for row-reducing large matrices, however their code is slightly cursed right now, so I can't make any promises on that.
