prgmGETPROBS

The programs in subroutines here run consecutively, one after the other. As such, it would be very easy to combine most of the code into a singular program. However, breaking the program into subroutines and functions as done here makes it easier to troubleshoot, which is why that was done here.

VARIABLES USED:

Many real variables were used, as well as lists L1, PROBS, and RREF. Matrix [E] was used to store the main matrix. More detail on when these variables are used will be provided in future versions of this documentation.
