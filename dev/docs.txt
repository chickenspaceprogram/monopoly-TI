The programs in subroutines here run consecutively, one after the other. As such, it would be very easy to combine most of the code into a singular program. However, breaking the program into subroutines and functions as done here makes it easier to troubleshoot.

VARIABLES USED:

Many real variables were used, as well as lists L1, PROBS. Matrices [E]-[J] were also used. More detail on when these variables are used may be provided in future versions of this documentation.
