DESCRIPTION:

prgmFASTRREF is intended to be a faster way to find the reduced echelon form of certain matrices. It doesn't reduce the total number of operations that need to be performed; rather, it ensures that as many of those operations as possible are performed by the calculator's inbuilt subroutines rather than by TI-BASIC code.

This speeds up the overall calculation since the inbuilt subroutines are far faster than anything coded in TI-BASIC.

HOW IT WORKS:

At a high level, here's what happens:

--- 1 - Partition the matrix into blocks ---

[E] = [ [F] [G] ]
      [ [H] [I] ]

--- 2 - Reduce it into block-upper-triangular form ---

[E] ~ [ [F]          [G]        ]
      [  0   [I] - [H][F^-1][G] ]

[I] - [H][F^-1][G] can just be calculated directly with matrix multiplication and inversion, and this calculation only takes up at minimum about 12000 bytes at a time, well within the margin we have to work with.

--- 3 - Reduce resulting top and bottom blocks separately with rref() ---

rref( [ [F]  [G] ] )
rref( [  0  [I] - [H][F^-1][G] ] )

--- 4 - Recombine blocks into a single matrix ---
--- 5 - Reduce the upper right corner with a TI-BASIC program ---

And that should reduce [E] to reduced row echelon form!
